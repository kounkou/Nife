0.9.27  12 January 2005

    This has been a long time in the making...  Release highlights:
        o New stdio implementation
        o New optimized string functions
        o Major improvements to the shared lib loader
        o Shared libraries work properly on powerpc
        o Debugging works on mips
        o New architectures: frv, nios, nios2, bfin
        o Linux 2.6.x kernel support
        o Lots and lots of bug fixes

    This release is NOT binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.26 or any earlier
    release, so be prepared to recompile your software if you are still using
    an old version of uClibc.
