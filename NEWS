	  - Adding NetErr to get the Net Error value.
	* Adding the ex directory in src with some program examples :
	  - gp.nif, an example for gplot functions,

2012-06-06 - Nife 0.320 is released.
	* Beginning of the gplot module for use of gnuplot (www.gnuplot.info).
	* adding theses functions :
          - gplot and gplotM (multiple) to create gplots,
          - gplotCmd to append text to the plot command,
          - ?gp to list the gplots,
          - del_gplot to delete a gplot,
          - gplotAdd and gplotRepl (with replacement) to add values to plots,
          - gplotClear to clear a display panel.
	* The installation has been tested by Bruno Guilbert on a Fox board G20
	  (Debian debarm 2.6.38 with CPU Atmel AT91SAM9G20 based on ARM926EJ-S)
	  with the students TRSE2 of Ingesup-Paris :
